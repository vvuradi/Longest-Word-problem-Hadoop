Longest-Word
============

Finding the Longest word made of other words in the given input file.

This program reads a file containing a sorted list of words (one word per line, no spaces, all lower case), then identifies the 1st and 2nd longest words in the file that can be constructed by concatenating copies of shorter words also found in the file and the total number of such words in the file.
